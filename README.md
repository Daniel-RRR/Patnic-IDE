## Overview
P@nicroom is more than a Game, its a Platform! By Installing this Enviroment, you get...

**The Base-game**
* Inspired by the **abstract but fascinating** ASCII-Rougelikes from the 80s
* Set in a World of **Shadowrun**: where Man meets **Magic and Machine**.
* **Experimental** design and **automated Wiki** which rewards Player who learn to exploit it.
* **Systemic Design** and **DOP** to enable emergent Gameplay and personal narratives.

**Its Content-creator**
* **read, write and share elements** of the Game without needing knowledge in Coding.
* **own Textformat for declaration**, the nearest comparrison is a mix of Markdown and JSON
* **Browsing and filtering by attributes** for Elements

**And our In-House setup**
* Improved Structure and Navigation by **Line-formatting, Bookmarking and Modulariced Implementations**
* Guided Implementation by  **flow-charts, IDE-shortcuts and Snippets**
* **CLI written in Rust** for pipelined processes and Workflow automation




Looking for more details?
* [**Webpage**](daniel-rrr.github.io/index.html) for generall info about the Game.
* [**Wiki**](daniel-rrr.github.io/wiki.html) for specific info about Features.

## Getting started
P@nicroom is not your average Game.
In this early Stage, it can feel empty or even frstrating.
But we also know from our initial interviews of new player that it can be intruiging and provoking curiosity.
We made a whole [Guide]() about the mindset for the Game,here are the most important hints summariced.

**Play the Game and realize, there is no Goal, winning or cheating**
* Its all about Experimenting! Panicroom is a sandbox with a Chemistry set for kids, including plutonium.
* Everything is gearing towards Chaos. Its easier to burn things down than to plant new greens.
* Entering the same Panicroom can be mindnumbingly easy or downright impossible, depending on your set of Abillites.
* Cheat! without hesitation or guilt. Use the wiki to meta-game! like stated above, if you get softblocked just activate Noclip to walk through solid Object.

**When you crave for more, DIY!**
* A lot of our time and energy does not go into new content, but into their underlying rules and compatibillity. So you can tailor them to your specific interests.
* Save your creations! Put them into collections and share them with others! maybe, someone out there built your perfect content.

**Stay up to date**
* There are many entries on our TODO-list, from the most basic stuff to ridicoulusly nieche one. Its in the Nature of an open ended sandbox, we go with the flow. Remember there is a bi-weekly update with a note of its additions.
* Contact us! we like to migrate your content into the public version and do give credit in our text-files, be a part of the development. Due to the content-creator, you dont even need to learn to code

## Documentation
Panicroom is a complex and intricate Enviroment of multiple Languages and Userstories.
For this Reason we are momentarily focused on the **Documentation of the Base-game** alone.  
We also appreciate feedback to improve its wording, formatting and Navigation!


We are Mainting two Types of Documentations:
1. **The Wiki** is for **Player** and content creator.   
It contains the most elements found in the Game and lists their attributes.  
We keep the Technical terms at a minimum. Most of it is maintained by our Automation.
1. **The Docs** is for **Developer**.  
It contains more Abstract explanations about our Framework and usefull functioncalls of the APIs ofModules.  
Developer may still want to use the Wiki to get specific Infos about game elements.
